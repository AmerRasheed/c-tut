C Tutorial
=====================================

In this repo we are practicing C. We will cover all the important topics.

## Installations
  * Clone the repo `https://github.com/iloveyii/c-tut/`.
  * Run the script as 
```bash
   gcc pointers.c && ./a.out
``` 


## Arrays

## Pointers 
  * To understand the concept of pointers better let say that there are two types of buckets that hold any value in C.
  * The first type of bucket is saving any data type in C.
  * The second type is a bucket that holds address of a memory location.
 ```bash
    int x = 123; // bucket loc is 802
    int * ptr = &x; // bucket loc is 806
```

  * In the above code snippet x is simply an integer variable (bucket) holding value 123.
  * `*ptr` is a variable (bucket) holding the address`(*)` of a variable of data type integer (int).
  * This can be visualized in the figure below.

  * The important point is that each bucket (location) in the figure above has address (as it is RAM)
  * The bucket (memory location) where x is stored has address `0802` and ptr is point it.
  * This location can be accessed by two ways, using `x` or pointer `ptr` which is equal to `&x`
  * At the same time we can save the address of (bucket) ptr as well like `Ã¬nt **ptr2`
  
  * To access the content in bucket where ptr is pointing to use content operator `*ptr`
  * To access the content in bucket where ptr2 is pointing to use content operator `*ptr2`
  * To access the content where ptr2 is pointing, and then where that value (address) is pointing to `**ptr2`, this is also called double indirection.
  * As we said in the start of this section that there are two types of buckets, hence if we try to save address of memory location we need to use address operator `&` and to declare such variable its must have star like `int* ptr`

## Array pointer
Array is a special type of data structure in C.
  * It saves several values in adjacent locations like the shape of a ladder
  * It implements Iterative interface which means its elements can be accessed using A[i] notation
  * `A` is a pointer in itself and we can add increments to it to get values at different indices
  * To get address of index A[i] use address of operator like `&A[i]`
